                    In an attempt to make our console more user friendly,
                    we thought of creating a custom menu
                    that would be more intuitive to use.
                    After analysing
                    <a href="https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer" target="_blank">MiSTer's main binary</a>,
                    we found the file responsible for handling the menu

                    Today we grabbed another Arduino

                    To finish off the controllers we had to
                    separate the pin bars to the size of our choosing:<br><br>

                    We soldered the pin bars and tested the connections with a multimeter:<br><br>

                    While sloting everything into place, we noticed the joysticks
                    were bumping into the buttons (oops, a little miscalculation üíÄ).
                    To solve this we cut a bit of the joystick.<br><br>

                    Here we have both of the controllers finalized:<br>

                    When we went to test them, an Arduino wasn't working.
                    We will test them another day...

                    They were confused and we sent an email to the curriculum unit responsible

                <p class="tabbingLVL2">
                    We started making the left sided controllers' PCB.
                    Sr. Rui made most of the first one as we watched
                    so we could learn how to do it!<br>
                    We grabbed a sheet of copper and noted on it the size of the PCB
                    with the help of a piece of paper where we printed the front copper layer.
                    We then cut the sheet of copper:<br><br>

                    </video><br>

                    After that we tapped the piece of paper with the ink
                    sided with the copper so that the ink would stick to it.
                    We then placed it in a heated rolling machine:<br><br>

                    <video class="center format_video_h" height="auto" controls>

                    </video><br>

                    After we rolled it a few times, we placed the copper piece in water
                    to cool it so we could take out the paper.
                    We had to rub it to take it out and had to be careful not to use nails
                    as not to take out the ink as it could interrupt the tracks
                    (the below video is from the other PCB as we forgot to film this one):<br><br>

                    </video><br>

                    With this we just had to make sure the tracks were stuck together
                    to then throw it in the acid tub, where the stuff
                    on the surface of the sheet would erode
                    (there were a few times where they weren't
                    and we had to remake the whole process again):<br><br>

                    After this we just had to rub some acetone on the PCBs to clean it up:<br><br>

                    After this we went to make the other PCB (the right one)
                    so we repeated the previous process yet again.<br>

                <p class="tabbingLVL2">
                    As we want Bluetooth controllers that are on two different sides of the console,
                    we also have to separate them in two different microcontrollers.
                    To make MiSTer recognize it as only one Bluetooth device we need to
                    send data from one microcontroller to another.<br><br>
                    To do so we use an ESP protocol called
                    <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/solutions/low-power-solutions/esp-now" target="_blank">ESP-NOW</a>
                    (that works with the ESP8266, ESP32, ESP32-S and ESP32-C SoCs).
                    This protocol is faster, allows for long-distance communication and is ultra low-power
                    which makes it awesome to transfer data between two ESP32 microcontrollers.<br><br>
                    To recap, we grab the data from the inputs from one microcontroller,
                    send them to the other one via ESP-NOW who then processes their own inputs
                    and the ones received by ESP-NOW and sends them through Bluetooth to MiSTer.<br><br>

                    To compensate for it we will try to do other things like external audio and video
                    and bluetooth controllers.

                    We also discussed some material 
                    (like the display, an Arduino and some connectors)
                    asked for about a month ago.
                    It seems like the request didn't fully went through because
                    of a change in how we should request the materials.
                    We were then asked by Marcelino and Francisco to elaborate
                    a spreadsheet with the materials of that "lost" list and
                    another one that was asked further ahead.
                    The spreadsheet was delivered to them today and new material should be on its way.

                <h4>[Jo√£o P.]</h4>
        
                <p class="tabbingLVL2">
                    At the start we had the idea to use the FPGA to manage the controls
                    while avoiding the use of extra hardware, in order to decrease the cost of our product.<br>
                    However, the software that we are using (MiSTerFPGA)
                    was only made for the use of external controllers
                    that we would connect through USB or Bluetooth.<br>
                    We thought that the handling of the input of the controllers
                    would only be through the FPGA logic tables,
                    which we could alter so it could use the spare pins instead of the USB/Bluetooth.<br>
                    However, once we looked at the MiSTerFPGA code,
                    they were using various different code languages (VHDL, systemVerilog, etc)
                    that we had to learn to understand how the MiSTer worked.<br>
                    After we mastered the different languages,
                    we noticed the input handling was more complex than what we were thinking.<br>
                    Each console had their way to handle the inputs,
                    and were using the cpu to handle the controls of the inputs.
                    To alter this, it would be necessary to learn in detail
                    how the mister uses the cpu and also each console.
                    It would take a lot of time and effort to even learn how to do it,
                    to the point that it wouldn't be doable to have it finished in time.
                    Then we concluded that it wouldn't be worth to alter the MiSTerFPGA code.
                    Besides being very complex and time consuming,
                    it would be unable to receive MiSTerFPGA updates that the community is always working for.<br>
                    Thus we just decided to build the detachable bluetooth controllers.

                    After our laboratory class, we asked for two Schottky diodes to test their functionality.
                    We set up a simple circuit with a voltage generator, a 11ohm resistor, and a diode.
                    In the photos we took, it is possible to conclude that the diode loses 0.3738V
                    instead of the 0.2V that the teacher had told us.<br><br>

                    on the other hand, they recharge in 14 hours, which is bad for the demo day.
                    The professor suggested using two Schottky diodes to implement a circuit that is in use on mobile phones.

                    Started development of the PCB for the controller.
                    We chose Ki-Cad to develop the PCB because of its free-of-use,
                    constant updates and broad documentation,
                    making it a great tool to learn for the future.<br>

                    We started by making a symbol for the joysticks (which was previously non existant):<br><br>
                    <img src="Images/Changelog/Joystick_Symbol.webp" class="center fotos_v" alt="Desenho Symbol dos Joysticks"></img><br>

                    Then we made the schematic of the circuit
                    that will be put into the PCB. We ended up with something like the following:<br><br>
                    <img src="Images/Changelog/Circuit_PCB_Schematic.webp" class="center fotos_h" alt="Desenho Schematic do Circuito da PCB"></img><br>
                    
                    After that, to make the PCB layout itself we first had to make a schematic for the PCB,
                    to do that we first needed a footprint for the joysticks
                    (which is a drawing of how a device should look on the PCB layout).<br><br>

                <h4>[Everyone]</h4>

                <p class="tabbingLVL2">
                    A part of the team tried to get VGA output from the FPGA to make testing more convenient as many of the monitors
                    were VGA only.
                    Unfortunately, after messing around with the settings, we were unable to do so,
                    as apparently only some VGA to HDMI adaptors work with the MiSTer project.
                    Another part of the team went to test if we could get the FPGA working on DC voltage through a connector made
                    by Sr. Rui (Laboratory helper from the Taguspark campus):<br><br>
                    <img src="Images/Changelog/FPGA_DC_Connector.webp" class="center fotos_v" alt="FPGA DC Connector"></img><br>
                    With this we were able to confidently determine the necessary voltage and current to power the fpga,
                    even when running it's most demanding core:<br><br>
                    <img src="Images/Changelog/DC_Output.webp" class="center fotos_h" alt="FPGA DC Connector"></img><br>
                    For a good while, we were unsure of how much voltage it actually required,
                    since although most of the documentation says it required 5V and 1A,
                    for some reason the fpga has an LED that light's up when it receives 3.3V of power,
                    which left us a bit confused, as we have no idea why this value was picked.<br>
                    The highest value we noted was about 5V and 1.1A, making it safe to assume the FPGA
                    won't consume more than 10W of power constantly.<br>
                    As we did this work session a little bit before our project reunion, during our work session
                    Marcelino and Francisco appeared to check out our work. They came with a projector with and HDMI input
                    so we could show them what we did until now.
                    Here's an overview video of what we did:<br><br>

                <h3 class="general_title">Temperature measurements and PSX and NES cores update (29/02/2024):</h3>
                <h4>[Miguel, Jo√£o P.]</h4>

                <p class="tabbingLVL2">
                    The team measured the FPGA running at 45¬∫C after about half an hour of PSX gameplay,
                    the core that is probably most demanding.
                    We will do further testing in a closed box,
                    but the temps seem probably fine and just an heat sink on the FPGA's processor
                    should do the work.
                    <br><br>

                    The PSX core is now working! We had to load a
                    <a href="https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/PSX_MiSTer#bios" target="_blank">PSX BIOS</a>
                    to make it work but it is now working fine!<br><br>

                    About the NES core, we discovered it had something to do with how the original games and consoles were made.
                    It seems like the NES core for the MiSTer project was made using USA standards,
                    that is, based on USA outlet frequencies.
                    Because of this, only USA ROMs for games should work with the NES core,
                    making other ROMs from Japan or Europe run differently from intended.

                <h4>[Half time: Jo√£o P., Bernardo, Gon√ßalo]</h4>

                <p class="tabbingLVL2">
                    We started by following the
                    <a href="https://mister-devel.github.io/MkDocs_MiSTer/setup/software/" target="_blank">tutorial on the MiSTer FPGA documentation website</a>.
                    So we flashed the micro SD card that came with the FPGA and booted up the FPGA with it:<br><br>
                    <img src="Images/Changelog/FPGA_Setup.webp" class="center fotos_h" alt="FPGA Setup"></img><br>
                    
                    It went into setup mode:<br><br>
                    <img src="Images/Changelog/MiSTer_Software_Setup.webp" class="center fotos_h" alt="MiSTer Software Setup"></img><br>

                    After that we waited some time as it said in the installation image (as seen above), but all we would get was a black screen.
                    We tried a bunch of things including flashing the micro SD card again, changing monitors, etc,... But nothing seemed to work.<br>
                    We saw an example config file that seemed to have an option to allow VGA output. As all the monitors we were using at the time had VGA only input
                    we tried moving to a different room that had an HDMI input. We then found a room that had a projector with HDMI input so we went with that.
                    We tried doing the setup again and soon enough we had a video output!<br><br>

                    After that we connected the FPGA through ethernet to run an updater script to download all the cores<br><br>

                    We then loaded some games into a games folder on the micro SD card and played a bit!<br><br>

                    Unfortunately NES games were running faster than intended and PSX games weren't running at all... The team will look into it.

                    We also were informed the material we ordered already arrived! Unfortunately we couldn't get it at the time
                    so Francisco will give it to Prof. Marcelino so he can deliver it to us on Monday.

                    The team had a meeting with the project's scientific advisor Prof. Fernando Gon√ßalves about the material list and the project proposal.<br>
                    We settled that, for now, we would order the FPGA (DE10-Nano from Terasic) with the SDRAM module and some joysticks.
                    Other things like the battery or the screen would come later.
                    We also wanted to get some buttons already but we were told there were already some within T√©cnico so there wouldn't be a need.<br>
                    As for the project proposal, Prof. Fernando Gon√ßalves agreed on everything we proposed
                    (you could see some of the propositions on the "planning" section of the website).<br>
                    We will soon send the temporary material list to be ordered.<br>
