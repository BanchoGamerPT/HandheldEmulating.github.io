                    After receiving some feedback from the other elements of the group
                    and some potential users, we made some updates on the case.
                    You can see the current state of it below:<br><br>

                <p class="tabbingLVL2">
                    Today we presented the mid-term presentation.
                    The final version of it will be available soon in the
                    <a href="planning.html" target="_blank"> planning section</a>.<br>
                    We also discussed some material 
                    (like the display, an arduino and some connectors)
                    asked for about a month ago.
                    It seems like the request didn't fully went through because
                    of a change in how we should request the materials.
                    We were then asked by Marcelino and Francisco to elaborate
                    a spreadsheet with the materials of that "lost" list and
                    another one that was asked further ahead.
                    The spreadsheet was delivered to them today and new material should be on its way.

                    In this day the team gathered and researched for new options for our power system
                    as previous solutions either charged too slowly or didn't have much capacity.<br>
                    We were looking for how we would do the circuit described in

                        Update 14</a>
                    and stumbled upon a miracle IC.<br><br>
                    This IC has a connector for the battery and uses its energy to power a USB-A output.
                    It also accepts a 5V 2.4A USB-C input and, if it has it, will start charging the battery
                    and also powers the circuit through the USB-A while at it!
                    It was quite the godsent if you ask us...<br>

                    After our laboratory class, we asked for two Schottky diodes to test their functionality.
                    We set up a simple circuit with a voltage generator, a 11ohm resistor, and a diode.
                    In the photos we took, it is possible to conclude that the diode loses 0.3738V
                    instead of the 0.2V that the teacher had told us.<br><br>

                    We explained our problem with the battery life of the console.
                    The batteries available on the market gives us 3 hours of use;
                    on the other hand, they recharge in 14 hours, which is bad for the demo day.
                    The professor suggested using two Schottky diodes to implement a circuit that is in use on mobile phones.
                    This circuit makes it so it uses outlet power to power the console while also charging the battery.<br><br>

                    We tested them out with an Arduino Uno to made sure they worked

                <h4>[João D.]</h4>

                <p class="tabbingLVL2">
                    Started development of the PCB for the controller.
                    We chose Ki-Cad to develop the PCB because of its free-of-use,
                    constant updates and broad documentation,
                    making it a great tool to learn for the future.<br>

                    We started by making a symbol for the joysticks (which was previously non existant):<br><br>
                    <img src="Images/Joystick_Symbol.webp" class="center fotos_v" alt="Desenho Symbol dos Joysticks"></img><br>

                    Then we made the schematic of the circuit
                    that will be put into the PCB. We ended up with something like the following:<br><br>
                    <img src="Images/Circuit_PCB_Schematic.webp" class="center fotos_h" alt="Desenho Schematic do Circuito da PCB"></img><br>
                    
                    After that, to make the PCB layout itself we first had to make a schematic for the PCB,
                    to do that we first needed a footprint for the joysticks
                    (which is a drawing of how a device should look on the PCB layout).<br><br>
                    <img src="Images/Joystick_Footprint.webp" class="center fotos_v" alt="Footprint dos Joysticks"></img><br>

                    And so we made the PCB layout:<br><br>

                    The rest of the PCB will be made in the future
                    and adjustments may be made on the parts shown above.<br>

                        We'll keep the blog updated about it!

                <p class="tabbingLVL2">
                    The Arduino code for detecting controls is working but unfortunately
                    we don't have enough cables to make every connection needed right now.<br>
                    We also don't yet have the Arduino required to make it function as a keyboard
                    (We have a borrowed Arduino Uno but we would need, for example, an Arduino Nano ESP32).
                    Here you can find the

                        full list of supported devices</a>.<br>
                    We were thinking about using an Arduino Nano ESP32 as it is
                    the smallest, the least expensive of them all and does all we want.<br>
                    We will post the Arduino code on GitHub when we make sure it works on an Arduino Nano ESP32 board.<br><br>

                    In the end, the idea is to have everything, control-wise, in a PCB.

                    The team discussed about possible legal issues for the project (questions about hardware and software emulation legality).
                    We concluded that, for the hardware side at least, we were clear, as emulators have been declared legal in past lawsuits.
                    Only the inclusion of illegally distributed ROM's of the games could bring us trouble (which obviously we don't plan on doing).

                <p class="tabbingLVL2">
                    A part of the team tried to get VGA output from the FPGA to make testing more convenient as many of the monitors
                    were VGA only.
                    Unfortunately, after messing around with the settings, we were unable to do so,
                    as apparently only some VGA to HDMI adaptors work with the MiSTer project.
                    Another part of the team went to test if we could get the FPGA working on DC voltage through a connector made
                    by Sr. Rui (Laboratory helper from the Taguspark campus):<br><br>

                    With this we were able to confidently determine the necessary voltage and current to power the fpga,
                    even when running it's most demanding core:<br><br>
                    <img src="Images/DC_Output.webp" class="center fotos_h" alt="FPGA DC Connector"></img><br>
                    For a good while, we were unsure of how much voltage it actually required,
                    since although most of the documentation says it required 5V and 1A,
                    for some reason the fpga has an LED that light's up when it receives 3.3V of power,
                    which left us a bit confused, as we have no idea why this value was picked.<br>
                    The highest value we noted was about 5V and 1.1A, making it safe to assume the FPGA
                    won't consume more than 10W of power constantly.<br>
                    As we did this work session a little bit before our project reunion, during our work session
                    Marcelino and Francisco appeared to check out our work. They came with a projector with and HDMI input
                    so we could show them what we did until now.
                    Here's an overview video of what we did:<br><br>

                <h4>[Miguel, João P.]</h4>

                <p class="tabbingLVL2">
                    The team measured the FPGA running at 45ºC after about half an hour of PSX gameplay,
                    the core that is probably most demanding.
                    We will do further testing in a closed box,
                    but the temps seem probably fine and just an heat sink on the FPGA's processor
                    should do the work.
                    <br><br>

                    The PSX core is now working! We had to load a
                    <a href="https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/PSX_MiSTer#bios" target="_blank">PSX BIOS</a>
                    to make it work but it is now working fine!<br><br>

                    About the NES core, we discovered it had something to do with how the original games and consoles were made.
                    It seems like the NES core for the MiSTer project was made using USA standards,
                    that is, based on USA outlet frequencies.
                    Because of this, only USA ROMs for games should work with the NES core,
                    making other ROMs from Japan or Europe run differently from intended.

                <h4>[Full time: João D., Miguel, Lucas]</h4>
                <h4>[Half time: João P., Bernardo, Gonçalo]</h4>

                <p class="tabbingLVL2">
                    We started by following the
                    <a href="https://mister-devel.github.io/MkDocs_MiSTer/setup/software/" target="_blank">tutorial on the MiSTer FPGA documentation website</a>.
                    So we flashed the micro SD card that came with the FPGA and booted up the FPGA with it:<br><br>
                    <img src="Images/FPGA_Setup.webp" class="center fotos_h" alt="FPGA Setup"></img><br>
                    
                    It went into setup mode:<br><br>
                    <img src="Images/MiSTer_Software_Setup.webp" class="center fotos_h" alt="MiSTer Software Setup"></img><br>

                    After that we waited some time as it said in the installation image (as seen above), but all we would get was a black screen.
                    We tried a bunch of things including flashing the micro SD card again, changing monitors, etc,... But nothing seemed to work.<br>
                    We saw an example config file that seemed to have an option to allow VGA output. As all the monitors we were using at the time had VGA only input
                    we tried moving to a different room that had an HDMI input. We then found a room that had a projector with HDMI input so we went with that.
                    We tried doing the setup again and soon enough we had a video output!<br><br>

                    After that we connected the FPGA through ethernet to run an updater script to download all the cores<br><br>

                    <br>

                    We then loaded some games into a games folder on the micro SD card and played a bit!<br><br>

                    Unfortunately NES games were running faster than intended and PSX games weren't running at all... The team will look into it.

                    The team had a meeting with the project's scientific advisor Prof. Fernando Gonçalves about the material list and the project proposal.<br>
                    We settled that, for now, we would order the FPGA (DE10-Nano from Terasic) with the SDRAM module and some joysticks.
                    Other things like the battery or the screen would come later.
                    We also wanted to get some buttons already but we were told there were already some within Técnico so there wouldn't be a need.<br>
                    As for the project proposal, Prof. Fernando Gonçalves agreed on everything we proposed
                    (you could see some of the propositions on the "planning" section of the website).<br>
                    We will soon send the temporary material list to be ordered.<br>
