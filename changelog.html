                <p class="tabbingLVL2">
                    We asked Dr Marli Gomes about the material list and she said she was waiting on supplier estimate for the material.

                <p class="tabbingLVL2">
                    The temporary material list was sent to Dr Marli Gomes from the Scientific Area of Electronics
                    so hopefuly we can start working as soon as the 2nd semester starts.

                <h3 class="general_title">Reunion with scientific advisor for material list and project proposal (19/12/2023):</h3>
                <p class="tabbingLVL2">
                    The team had a meeting with the project's scientific advisor Prof. Fernando Gonçalves about the material list and the project proposal.<br>
                    We settled that, for now, we would order the FPGA (DE10-Nano from Terasic) with the SDRAM module and some joysticks.
                    Other things like the battery or the screen would come later.
                    We also wanted to get some buttons already but we were told there were already some within Técnico so there wouldn't be a need.<br>
                    As for the project proposal, Prof. Fernando Gonçalves agreed on everything we proposed
                    (you could see some of the propositions on the "planning" section of the website).<br>
                    We will soon send the temporary material list to be ordered.<br>
