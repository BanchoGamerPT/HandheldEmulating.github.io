                    They were challenged to do a project and decided to do one on a portable game console based on

                        We were finally allowed authorization to use the PCB workshop!
                        With this we started working as soon as possible.

                        HUGE thanks to Sr. Rui, our labs technician
                        for helping us out with making the PCB
                        and working extra hours to do so,
                        we cannot express our gratitude towards you for helping us out!

                    <p class="tabbingLVL2">
                        We started making the left sided controllers' PCB.
                        Sr. Rui made most of the first one as we watched
                        so we could learn how to do it!<br>
                        We grabbed a sheet of copper and noted on it the size of the PCB
                        with the help of a piece of paper where we printed the front copper layer.
                        We then cut the sheet of copper:<br><br>

                        After that we tapped the piece of paper with the ink
                        sided with the copper so that the ink would stick to it.
                        We then placed it in a heated rolling machine:<br><br>
    
                        <video class="center format_video_h" height="auto" controls>
                            <source src="Video/Heated_Rolling_Machine.mp4" type="video/mp4">

                        </video><br>
    
                        After we rolled it a few times, we placed the copper piece in water
                        to cool it so we could take out the paper.
                        We had to rub it to take it out and had to be careful not to use nails
                        as not to take out the ink as it could interrupt the tracks
                        (the below video is from the other PCB as we forgot to film this one):<br><br>

                        </video><br>
    
                        With this we just had to make sure the tracks were stuck together
                        to then throw it in the acid tub, where the stuff
                        on the surface of the sheet would erode
                        (there were a few times where they weren't
                        and we had to remake the whole process again):<br><br>
    
                        <img src="Images/Changelog/Acid_Vat_PCB.webp" class="center fotos_h" alt="Teste da Bateria"></img><br>
    
                        After this we just had to rub some acetone on the PCBs to clean it up:<br><br>
    
                        <img src="Images/Changelog/Left_PCB_NoHoles.webp" class="center fotos_h" alt="Teste da Bateria"></img><br>
    
                        After this we went to make the other PCB (the right one)
                        so we repeated the previous process yet again.<br>
                        While we waited for the right one to hatch on the acid vat,
                        we drilled most the left PCB:<br><br>

                        We'll try to finish at least one of the PCBs tomorrow
                        (at least holes, maybe soldering the sockets)!
