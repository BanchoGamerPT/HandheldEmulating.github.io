                    This project is from a group of 6 students from
                    <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/" target="_blank">Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico</a> (IST).
                    They were challenged to do a project and decided to do one on a portable game console based on
                    <a href="https://mister-devel.github.io/MkDocs_MiSTer/" target="_blank">MiSTer FPGA</a>
                    for the curricular unit

                    The project is funded entirely by IST.

                    <p class="tabbingLVL2">
                        We started by following the
                        <a href="https://mister-devel.github.io/MkDocs_MiSTer/setup/software/" target="_self">tutorial on the MiSTer FPGA documentation website</a>.
                        So we flashed the micro SD card that came with the FPGA and booted up the FPGA with it:<br><br>
                        <img src="Images/FPGA_Setup.webp" class="center" alt="FPGA Setup"></img><br>
                        
                        It went into setup mode:<br><br>
                        <img src="Images/MiSTer_Software_Setup.jpg" class="center" alt="MiSTer Software Setup"></img><br>
    
                        After that we waited some time as it said in the installation image (as seen above), but all we would get was a black screen.
                        We tried a bunch of things including flashing the micro SD card again, changing monitors, etc,... But nothing seemed to work.<br>
                        We saw an example config file that seemed to have an option to allow VGA output. As all the monitors we were using at the time had VGA only input
                        we tried moving to a different room that had an HDMI input. We then found a room that had a projector with HDMI input so we went with that.
                        We tried doing the setup again and soon enough we had a video output!<br><br>

                        After that we connected the FPGA through ethernet to run an updater script to download all the cores<br><br>

                        <br>
    
                        We then loaded some games into a games folder on the micro SD card and played a bit!<br><br>
